         don't need to have stat_cat_entry elements. You could delete
         the dummy entry in this case.

	 The stat_cat attribute is the numeric id of the stat_cat for
	 the entry.

	 The required attribute indicates if the stat_cat is required
	 for saving a copy. If the stat_cat is not required, you can
	 delete this attribute or set its value to 0.

	 The element's text node is used as the asset.stat_cat_entry's
	 value in the database.

  <!-- You can add custom prompt messages in a <prompts> block.
       
       Each prompt can be defined with a cusom tag named for the
       prompt key in the %prompts hash in issa.pl. The prompt text, if
       different from the default, can go in a prompt tag. The regex,
       if different from the default, can go in a regex tag. The
       message goes in a message tag.

       You want to make certain that your regex allows a single letter
       Q (either upper or lower case) or there may be no escape from
       the program.

       Here's an example for the patron barcode prompt that changes
       all parts of the entry:

       <prompts>
       <patron>
       <prompt>Patron Barcode:</prompt>
       <regex>^(?:2\d{13}|[Qq])$</regex>
       <message>A patron barcode must be 14 digits and begin with a 2.</message>
       </patron>
       </prompts>

       You can have multiple prompts blocks or put all the custom
       prompt tags in a single block.

       It doesn't make sense to configure a custom prompt more than
       once, but if you do, the one that appears last in the file will
       take precedence over all previous ones.
