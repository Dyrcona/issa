This document describes the menu and prompt system for issa, the URSA/Evergreen integration program. The program operates on standard input and standard output with a simple menu and prompt-driven interface that should be easy to automate with expect or a similar program.

One general assumption of the program is that entering a single letter Q (either upper or lower case) at any prompt other than a title or name prompt will reset the program state and return to the main menu. Entering a single letter Q at the main menu prompt will log out of Evergreen and shut the program down.

The following section represents the menus and prompts in a stylized manner that we hop is easy to follow.

Main Menu
1. Retrieve Patron
2. Retrieve Bibliographic ID
3. Place Hold
4. Checkout Copy
5. Checkin Copy
6. Create Temporary Copy
7. Delete Temporary Copy
Q. Quit
Enter Choice [1-7,Q]>

Active Cards: Space-delimited list of patron cards (first is the main card)
Expiration Date: Date in ISO format or N/A if the patron does not expire
Status: One of Active, Juvenile, Inactive, or Barred or a list of standing penalties. (Active or Juvenile should be considered OK, any other response indicates the patron's privileges are blocked for some reason.)

PATRON_DELETED or PATRON_NOT_FOUND
